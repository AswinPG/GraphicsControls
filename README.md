[Microsoft.Maui.Graphics](https://github.com/dotnet/Microsoft.Maui.Graphics) is a cross-platform graphics library for iOS, Android, Windows, macOS and Linux completely in C#. With this library you can use a common API to target multiple abstractions allowing you to share your drawing code between platforms, or mix and match graphics implentations within a singular application.

## Goals

* Have pixel-perfect drawn controls working on all the .NET MAUI supported platforms.
* High performance and customization options controls.
